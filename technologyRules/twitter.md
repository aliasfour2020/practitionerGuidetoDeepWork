## Strategy

### Push Notifications

Turn on cell phone notifications to keep track of mentions and replies as well as specific individuals I follow and get a lot of value from. Use this instead of the basic twitter feed.

Only allow mentions and replies.

### Lists

Use Twitter lists to categorize my feeds by areas of interest.

* Writers
* Influencers
* Content Creators
* CloudSkills community contributors

### Hashtags

Use hashtags to browse for content of interest instead of the feed.

* #azure
* #devops

### Buffer

Use to queue and schedule tweets.

1. Prevents me from logging into Twitter.
2. Allows me to capture and share my thoughts and content.
3. [Schedule retweets to avoid spamming](https://buffer.com/library/schedule-retweets)
