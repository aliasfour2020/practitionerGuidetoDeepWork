## Monk Week

Idea: _Batching social media_

Theory Testing:

* Do immediate replies matter?
* Whats the minimum activity needed?
* Does high value content matter more than frequent interaction?
* How much mental space can I reclaim?
* What happens with few high value posts at high traffic times?

Metrics:

1. Tweet impressions
2. Posts analytics
    * views
    * reactions

_Will this drastically drop if I schedule all my shares & batch reply?_

When am I least productive?

### Check-ins

Purpose: _Reply to comments & direct messages._
